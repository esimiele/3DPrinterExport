Copyright (c) 2022 AB4D d.o.o.

By installing the Ab3d.PowerToys library (hereinafter "the SOFTWARE" or "SOFTWARE"), 
you are accepting the following License Agreement. 

LICENSE AGREEMENT

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you 
(either an individual or an entity) and AB4D d.o.o. for the software product
identified above. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, 
you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. 
 
If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install or use the SOFTWARE. 
 
 
1. GRANT OF LICENSE 

AB4D d.o.o. grants to you as an individual or entity a non-exclusive License to make and 
use copies of the SOFTWARE in the manner provided below. The SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.


2. EVALUATION LICENSE 

A time limited version of the SOFTWARE, Evaluation License, is provided for a period of sixty (60) days 
("Evaluation Period") from the date of installing an evaluation version. With Evaluation License you 
are hereby licensed to use the SOFTWARE for the purpose of exploring its features and evaluating its 
suitability for purchase. After this evaluation period has expired you must either purchase appropriate 
licenses or stop using the SOFTWARE and remove (uninstall) it from your computers.

The time limited version is subject to all terms in this EULA with the exception that the Evaluation 
License is not for general commercial use.


3. COMMERCIAL LICENSE

After you have purchased the license for the SOFTWARE, and have received a registration code
enabling the registered copy, you are licensed to include the SOFTWARE into your own product(s) 
and application(s). The license allows compiling and running your own product(s) and 
application(s) with the included SOFTWARE. The primary user of the computer on which each 
registered copy of the SOFTWARE is installed may make a second copy for his or her exclusive use 
on a second computer. Under no circumstances may the SOFTWARE be used in the development process 
at the same time on more than the number of computers for which you have paid a separate license fee. 

After you have purchased the license for the SOFTWARE, and have received a registration code 
enabling the registered copy, you are licensed to distribute your own product(s) and application(s) 
with the included SOFTWARE to the clients that do not have license for the SOFTWARE. 

Your own product(s) and application(s) must not document or make public the SOFTWARE API 
(Application Programming Interface). Your software product may not, in the reasonable opinion of AB4D d.o.o., 
compete with any product published from AB4D d.o.o. This means that your own product(s) and application(s) 
must not make possible to the customers outside your organization to convert 3ds, svg files or metafiles 
into xaml (in this case compete with Viewer3ds, ViewerSvg or Paste2Xaml). This restriction is not valid 
if your own product(s) and application(s) are used only inside the organization that has purchased a license 
for the SOFTWARE â€“ for example for a custom 3ds to xaml converter that is used only internally.

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend AB4D d.o.o. and its suppliers from and against any 
and all claims or lawsuits including attorney's fees that arise or result from the use or distribution 
of your software product.


4. RESTRICTIONS 

You must not redistribute the registration codes provided, neither on paper nor electronically.
 
You may not reverse engineer, copy, duplicate or distribute the license schema that is needed to use 
the SOFTWARE in a design, development or runtime environment. You may not disassemble, decompile or 
reverse engineer the SOFTWARE or any portions of it.

You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE. You may permanently transfer all of your rights under 
this EULA provided you transfer all copies of the SOFTWARE (including copies of all prior versions if 
the SOFTWARE is an upgrade) and registration codes and retain none, and the recipient agrees to 
the terms of this EULA.


5. TERMINATION 

Without prejudice to any other rights, AB4D d.o.o. may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with 
the terms and conditions of this EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE. 
You may terminate this license at any time by destroying the original and all copies of the SOFTWARE 
in whatever form. 


6. COPYRIGHT 

The SOFTWARE is owned by AB4D d.o.o. and is protected by European Union copyright laws and international 
treaty provisions.


7. LIMITED WARRANTY 

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.


8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

IN NO EVENT SHALL AB4D d.o.o. BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION 
OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR 
OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE, UNDERSTAND IT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AS 
THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US, SUPERSEDING ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR 
AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER 
OF THIS LICENSE.
